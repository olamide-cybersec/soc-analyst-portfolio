## 👩🏾‍💻 About Me

My name is **Olamide Ibijola**. I am a cybersecurity analyst focused on SOC operations, incident response, and threat detection. I hold **CompTIA Security+**, and I am preparing for **CySA+** while beginning the **Georgia Tech OMS Cybersecurity (Policy)** program.

I built this SOC Analyst Portfolio to demonstrate:
- hands-on malware analysis,
- phishing investigation,
- Windows log forensics,
- SIEM detections,
- and incident documentation.

My long-term goal is to become a cybersecurity leader (and eventually a CISO), and this portfolio is part of my journey.
